SciTE is a SCIntilla based Text Editor. Originally built to demonstrate
Scintilla, it has grown to be a generally useful editor with facilities 
for building and running programs. It is best used for jobs with simple 
configurations. 

There is an example configuration file (SciTEUser.properties) provided 
with the tarball. If you'd like to use it (at your own risk), learn the
different options, rename it to .SciTEUser.properties and place it under
your user's home directory.
