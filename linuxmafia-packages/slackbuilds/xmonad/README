xmonad (stable, featureful and easy tiling window manager for X11)

xmonad is a dynamically tiling X11 window manager that is written
and configured in Haskell. In a normal WM, you spend half your time
aligning and searching for windows. xmonad makes work easier, by
automating this.

This requires ghc and X11-haskell and libedit from SlackBuilds.org.

After installing, use 'xwmconfig' command to reselect xmonad as window
manager, either as root to do system wide selection or as normal user
to do user specific selection.

To get you started, the most basic key bindings are:
	mod-shift-return   Launch xterm
	mod-shift-q        Quit xmonad
