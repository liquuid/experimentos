awesome is a floating and tiling window manager initially based on a
rewrite of the dwm window manager.  It is extremely fast, small,
dynamic, and awesome. The version 3.x is incompatible with 2.x
configuration files.

awesome requires Imlib2 and Lua, available at SlackBuilds.org,
and also requires Cairo compiled with the flag --enable-xcb.
You can easily retrieve the original SlackBuild from a Slackware 
repository and recompile it yourself.
