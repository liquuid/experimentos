ghc (The Glasgow Haskell Compiler)

GHC is a state-of-the-art, open source, compiler and interactive 
environment for the functional language Haskell.
This is a complete build, including interactive system, profiling 
libraries and documentation.
This is packaged from a generic i386 linux binary distribution.

This requires libedit from SlackBuilds.org.
