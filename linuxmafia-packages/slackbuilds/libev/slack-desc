# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

libev: libev (A high-performance event loop/event model with lots of features) 
libev: 
libev: libev is a high-performance event loop/event model with lots of 
libev: features. It is modeled (very loosely) after libevent and the Event
libev: perl module, but is faster, scales better and is more correct, and also
libev: more featureful. And also smaller. Yay.
