# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

xcb-util: xcb-util (Convenience functions and interfaces for xcb) 
xcb-util: 
xcb-util: The xcb-util module provides a number of libraries which sit on top
xcb-util: of libxcb, the core X protocol library, and some of the extension 
xcb-util: libraries. These experimental libraries provide convenience 
xcb-util: functions and interfaces which make the raw X protocol more usable.
xcb-util: Some of the libraries also provide client-side code which is not 
xcb-util: strictly part of the X protocol but which have traditionally been 
xcb-util: provided by Xlib.
